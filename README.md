## Random Quote Generator - Famous French Chefs üç¥

Are you're looking for non-inspirational quotes from *Norbert Tarayre* and *Philippe Etchebest*?

Here is a simple application built to display a random quote from two famous french chefs. I created this to learn a bit more about Flask. Then, I got caught up in it so I decided to add React to make it more interactive.

To start using it, create the project and create a virtual environment

```
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install all dependencies from the requirements.txt file.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, go to http://localhost:3000 and enjoy!
